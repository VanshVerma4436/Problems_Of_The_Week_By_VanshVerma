🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3.x (primary language)

Jupyter Notebook (interactive development)

Built-in Libraries: math, itertools, etc.

📈 Complexity Analysis
Problem	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Algorithm Type
Equal Sum Partition	O(n × sum)	O(sum)	Dynamic Programming
Word Search 2D	O(M × N)	O(1)	Linear Search
GCD of N Numbers	O(n log M)	O(1)	Number Theory
🎯 Interview Tips

💡 Equal Sum Partition: Always check if sum is odd → quick elimination.
💡 Word Search: Handle row-wise & column-wise systematically.
💡 GCD Problems: Euclidean algorithm is the most efficient.
